# Kubernetes Cluster Components Overview

This document provides an overview of the key components involved in a Kubernetes cluster, specifically focusing on the roles of the Master Node (Control Plane) and Worker Nodes.

## Master Node (Control Plane)

### API Server
The API server is the central control point of the entire Kubernetes cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which clients (like `kubectl` or automation tools) use to interact with the cluster. It validates and processes requests, serving as the entry point for cluster management.

### etcd
`etcd` is a distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data. It acts as Kubernetes’ source of truth, storing configuration data, state information, and other critical data. The consistency and reliability of `etcd` are crucial for the stability of the cluster.

### Controller Manager
The Controller Manager includes various controllers that handle different aspects of the cluster’s desired state. Examples include the Replication Controller, which manages replica sets, and the Node Controller, which monitors and manages nodes.

### Scheduler
The Scheduler component assigns pods (containers) to nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints. It ensures that pods are distributed across the cluster effectively and optimally.

## Node (Minion)

### Kubelet
`Kubelet` is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It communicates with the API server to manage containers on that node. It starts, stops, and monitors containers, ensuring that they run as specified in their pod definitions.

### Container Runtime
The container runtime, such as Docker or containerd, is responsible for actually running containers on the node. `Kubelet` interacts with the container runtime to create and manage containers.

### Kube Proxy
`Kube Proxy` is responsible for network communication within the cluster. It manages network rules (like `iptables` rules) to provide network services to pods, such as load balancing and network routing.

### CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
CRI is an interface between `Kubelet` and the container runtime. It standardizes how `Kubelet` communicates with container runtimes, allowing for flexibility in choosing different container runtimes.
